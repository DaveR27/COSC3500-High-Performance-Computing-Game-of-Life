2. make all 

To Run program:
No visualization:
python3 display.py NoVis [Pattern Path] [Height] [Width] [Amount of Generation]
    Note:
        The project does come with some pattern files for running, there are located in Serial/PatternFiles

With visualization:
python3 display.py Vis [Pattern Path] [Height] [Width] [Amount of Generation]
    Note:
        With every run of the visualization, make sure there is no "game_of_life_save.txt" in current directory

To run/check experiments check the GatherData.py file:
    Note:
